This commitment is regularly reinforced by management and is outlined in the Google Code of Conduct, which is posted on Google’s website at https://abc.xyz/investor/other/code-of-conduct.html Google’s Security Philosophy is also outlined at the following page: http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/security.html.
The foundation of Google’s commitment to security is its set of security policies that cover physical, network and computer systems, applications services, systems services, account, data, data center security, corporate services, change management, and incident response. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis by Google's executive team to help ensure their continued effectiveness and accuracy.
In addition to these security policies, with which all persons employed by Google must comply, Google has a dedicated Security Team, which has responsibility for a security program that includes awareness raising, internal advocacy, training, strategic reviews, reviews and compliance audits. Google also requires that all third-party contractors comply with these security policies as well.","McKesson","2016-07-15","https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1YLVFPVFxmKXrpy4C96EqfFLR-RHIW0w0Ke8w8X5qquI/edit?usp=sharing"

10,"","How islogical accessto information and application systems and functions by users and by support personnel restricted in accordance with your company’s defined access control policy?","Access to sensitive information in production systems is controlled through authorization and authentication technologies, ensuring that only those specifically authorized to view, update, or delete data can do so. This access must be approved by the appropriate data owner, manager, or other executives, as dictated by Google’s security policies. Access rights and levels are based on the employee’s job function and role, using the concepts of least-privilege and need-to-know to ensure that access is commensurate with defined responsibilities. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes.
Access to individual production systems is reviewed periodically by the system owners to ensure that access has been removed for employees who no longer need access. Google follows a formal process to grant or revoke access to resources. In the event of an access violation, remedial action would be taken immediately as per policy.
Google employees are only granted a limited set of default permissions to access company resources, such as email, Google’s internal portal, and HR information. Requests for additional access follow a formal process that involves a request and an approval from a data or system owner, manager, or other executives, as dictated by Google’s security policies. Approvals are managed by workﬂow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. These tools control both the modiﬁcation of authorization settings and the approval process to ensure consistent application of the approval policies.

Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilizing RSA keys are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.

11,"","How isphysical accessto information and application systems and functions by users and by support personnel restricted in accordance with your company’s defined access control policy?","Google Data centers maintain secure external perimeter protections. All data centers employ electronic card key access control system that are linked to a system alarm. Access to perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas is logged, including unauthorized activity. Failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated as appropriate. Authorized access throughout the business operations and data centers is restricted based on an individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centers are alarmed and can only be opened from the inside. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centers. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to help cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data center building, and shipping/receiving.

25,"","Records Protection. How are important records at your company protected from loss, destruction, and falsification, in accordance with statutory, regulatory, contractual, and business requirements?","Internal records and documents are stored on Google Drive. Google Drive contains three primary functional components to protect content within the corpus:
Sharing controls Auditing and alert controls Content rights controlsSharing controls
With Google Drive, documents aren’t emailed as attachments, but rather they are shared via https hyperlinks. This centralizes access control in the cloud and allows content owners to grant and revoke permissions in a simple and secure way. While the document sharing is a user action, the available scope of sharing is controlled by administrators at a domain-wide level. Administrators can prevent sharing content outside of the domain, as well as set default sharing levels.
Google describes the sharing model in Drive asSharing That Just Works. Every piece of content within Drive has a access control list that governs ability to View, Comment, Edit and Share permissions. Adding a new collaborator to a document is easy - the owner (or if allowed to do so, an editor) simply clicks “Add new user”.
Once shared to the new collaborator, they would be able to work with document, as defined by the owner. The three levels of permissions are:
Edit rights. This gives the user the ability to edit the content. For Google formats (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, and Forms), this means that they can edit the files directly. For non-Google formats (PDFs, MS Office files, etc), this means that they can upload new versions of the document to overwrite the existing copy in Drive. NOTE: Editors do not have rights to add additional editors, unless the content owner allows them to do so. Comment rights. Commenters are not allowed to edit the content directly. However, they will be able to highlight content within the documents (Docs, Sheets and Slides) and insert comments. This is particularly helpful with content reviewers, to suggest changes or provide input to the editors. View rights. This is the most restrictive visibility setting. In this setting, the collaborator can only view the document and has no edit or comment privileges.Revoking access. If, at any point, the owner does not want a particular user to have access to the document any longer, they would simply remove the user’s rights from the sharing screen. Once removed from sharing, any synced copies of the document would be removed from iPads, Android phones, synced folders, etc. In fact, if the removed user has the document open within their web browser, they would see this page within a few seconds of access revocation.
Auditing and alerts
Google is investing significantly into its audit and alert framework for Apps. The following is a description of the current features:
Google Drive Auditing. Google Docs and Sheets are covered by auditing. The auditing that is available now includes View and Edit events. The Edit event is a catchall event type that includes create, edit and delete functions.
Google Apps Alerts. This alert framework allows for Apps Administrators to be immediately notified immediately via email when a particular activity occurs. The alerts framework includes user actions, such as new user creation, suspicious activity on user accounts, account deletion, and any permission changes within the administrative console.
Content rights controls
Currently, non-Google formatted content (PDFs, MS Office files, videos, etc) can be restricted from download.","McKesson","2016-07-15","https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1YLVFPVFxmKXrpy4C96EqfFLR-RHIW0w0Ke8w8X5qquI/edit?usp=sharing"

First, the disk is logically wiped by authorized individuals. The erasure consists of a full write of the drive with all zeroes (0x00) followed by a full read of the drive to ensure that the drive is blank. Then, another authorized individual performs a second inspection to confirm that the disk has been successfully wiped. These erase results are logged by the drive’s serial number for tracking.

215,"","Do you document how you grant and approve access to tenant data?","TBD by Customer: Google maintains a Data Security policy that governs access to customer data.

Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilizing RSA keys are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength. For access to extremely sensitive information (e.g., credit card data), Google uses hardware tokens.","Google - CAIQv3.0.1","2015-09-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gr4RYXgsqFqr8qe__GrJreeUYccz85Gr3M5zhc38W_I/edit#gid=41338190"

Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilizing RSA keys are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength. For access to extremely sensitive information (e.g., credit card data), Google uses hardware tokens.","Coca-Cola","2016-03-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZiQy_g0cQVmS_MPiXbyebdQT_Fn8RPePvCxlthYlEw/edit#gid=946975566"

What are your 1, 3 and 5 year plans, including goals and objectives (product roadmap?)","Google Cloud Platform's enterprise strategy is rooted in a vertical go to market approach with emphasis on our important and growing ecosystem (both GTM and ISVs).  We stratify market segments in sales with Field Sales focusing Named Accounts and Territory (with vertical orientation) along with our Inside Sales organization for scalable customer touch.  Our new ProServ team facilitates customer success and is investing in and enabling our partner service providers and will leverage applicable offerings (i.e. Security Assessment) they created in the Google Apps realm as well as create new tools and offerings they share with the partner community to facilitate customer and partner success. Finally, we offer stratified, multi-region follow the sun support including an option for dedicated deep technical account assistance through our Strategic Customer Engineering team, a key element in working with enterprise customers.

On the product front, GCP continues to prioritize and ship features critical to the enterprise. In early 2016, Cloud Identity & Access Management (IAM) became Generally Available to customers, providing easy to use, fine-grained access control across GCP resources. Cloud Virtual Network allows our customers to provision and manage GCP resources flexibly in a virtual private cloud (VPC), and admins can exert full control through networking policies they define -- including between their on-prem infrastructure and GCP to support hybrid use cases. Our Cloud Interconnect capability allows customers to treat GCP as an extension of their own infrastructure, by peering with GCP through low-latency, high-reliability connections with enterprise-grade encryption. Customers can connect their data center to ours either directly or through our extensive service provider partner ecosystem (https://cloud.google.com/interconnect).

GCP strives to make security a key reason to adopt public cloud. We remain committed to integrated, pervasive security -- enforcing security to the same degree as we protect our own services (Search, Maps, YouTube, Docs, etc). We also continue to certify compliance against the most recognized providers. Details at cloud.google.com/security

Regarding openness, Google recognizes and takes seriously the desire of customers to avoid lock-in, and that the enterprise cloud environment will be one of multi-cloud (including maintaining an on-prem footprint). Open source versions of many of our strongest offerings exist, like Cloud Dataflow (http://beam.incubator.apache.org), and Container Engine powered by Kubernetes (kubernetes.io). We enable enterprises to encapsulate their mission-critical applications and processes and deploy it where it makes most business sense, which we recognize can change based on many dynamic factors.

We've taken steps to support migration of mission critical on-prem workloads to GCP through VM migration -- including a service provider ecosystem of partners who can help users perform migration. https://cloud.google.com/migrate/ GCP intends to meet customers where they are today through a lift-and-evolve strategy, where our highly differentiated big data analytics/ML capabilities (https://cloud.google.com/products/#big-data) and ""serverless"" NoOps capabilities such as App Engine are adjacent for customers to take advantage of once they're on our cloud platform.

GCP enables customers to create peering connections with private data centers. IPSeC VPN with private Virtual networks (VPC) is also available. Direct private connectivity without IPSec is also prioritized in the roadmap, as an additional mechanism to seamlessly extend on-prem private space into the cloud private VPC. 

Our container strategy is based on Kubernetes, which enables customers to easily run container-based workloads on GCP, AWS, Azure, or on-prem.
---
Regarding multi-environments, the strategy is to integrate with Config management  tools / DevOps tools that are applicable to hybrid and multi-cloud environments.Some examples are multicloud libraries like Apache, Fog (Ruby), jclouds (Java), Config management tools CAPS like Chef,  Puppet, SaltStack, Ansible and DevOps tools like Vagrantup, Packer, Terraform. 
These tools allow integration and abstraction of resources across multiple environments, including Openstack deployments. 

Additional hybrid cloud supported features are: 
- Allow encryption with customer security keys. 
- Federation of identities across hybird environments by onboarding identities from on-prem LDAP 
- Rich VPC private environment with functions like routes and firewalls that seamlessly extends to on-prem

Another key cornerstone of hybrid cloud strategy are containers (Docker /  Mesos, kubernetes, RedHat OpenShift Cloud Foundry) which allow to extend workloads across hybrid environments with with a single orchestration and datamodel, providing seamless work portability across on-prem and public cloud.

Cloud Platform services automatically encrypt data before it is written to disk. For example, the data for each Cloud Storage object is encrypted under the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, and each encryption key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated set of master keys. Data in transit is encrypted using standard SSL/TLS protocols.

Google maintains a robust physical security staffing structure to protect its data centers and facilities around the globe. The hub of security operations is the Global Security Operations Center (GSOC), which monitors security alarms, devices, and Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) for every location 24 hours a day, 7 days the week.  The GSOC dispatches security officers at manned sites (including all data centers) to investigate and resolve alarms, concerns and potential risks that arise. The GSOC team also monitors global catastrophes, such as earthquakes and other incidents that may impact on the security and integrity of operations, and organizes emergency response / escalation if necessary.

Google employs multiple layers of defense to help protect the network perimeter from external attacks. Only authorized services and protocols that meet Google’s security requirements are permitted to enter  the network. These layers are designed to automatically drop unauthorized packets. Access to the network devices is limited to authorized personnel.
Google’s network security strategy is composed of the following elements:
- Tight control of the size and makeup of the network perimeter
- Permit only known and authorized traffic through the network perimeter
- Routing of all traffic through custom front-end servers that detect and stop malicious requests
- Use of RFC 1918 IP space to ensure external connections are never made directly to internal systems (e.g., network address translation)

514,"","How is the CHP platform architected to maximize Uptime & Availability of Services as needed by the Cummins CloudOne deployment?","Google Cloud Platform lets you easily and cost-effectively build and run web applications that are both scalable and resilient. Here is a high level overview of how the Google Cloud Platofrm is architected:  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones

Region - Regions are collections of zones. Zones have high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections to other zones in the same region. In order to deploy fault-tolerant applications that have high availability, Google recommends deploying applications across multiple zones and multiple regions. This helps protect against unexpected failures of components, up to and including a single zone or region.

Zone - A zone is an isolated location within a region. Depending on how widely you want to distribute your resources, create instances across multiple zones in multiple regions for redundancy.

Instance - An instance is a virtual machine hosted on Google’s infrastructure. You can install and configure these instances just like physical servers. In this document, you can use startup scripts and Chef to configure instances with the application server and code for the web application.

Instance group and instance group manager - An instance group is a collection of homogeneous instances that can be targeted by an HTTP load balancer. Instances are added to and removed from a group by an instance group manager. An instance group and corresponding manager are required for each zone you want to run in.

Autoscaler - The Compute Engine Autoscaler adds or removes Google Compute Engine instances to an instance group by interfacing with the group’s manager in response to traffic, CPU utilization, or other signals. In the example solution, the Autoscaler responds to the Request Per Second (RPS) metric of the HTTP load balancer. An Autoscaler is required for each instance group that you want scaled automatically.","Cummins","2016-04-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uEGuPR7Fr8OdPg8JsDq65Px5k7LiVM5QcB77C0CCUR0/edit#gid=2060915873"
515,"","What specific measures and efforts are anticipated to provide the existing Performance & Scale?","The following shows how different Google Cloud Platform services map to the key requirements necessary to make applications scalable and resilient.

Server hosting - Google Compute Engine Regions and Zones

HTTP load balancer - The HTTP load balancer exposes a single public IP address that customers use to access the application. This IP address can be associated with a DNS A record (e.g., example.com) or CNAME (e.g., www.example.com). Incoming requests are distributed across the instance groups in each zone according to each group’s capacity. Within the zone, requests are spread evenly over the instances within the group. The HTTP load balancer can also balance traffic across regions.

Autoscaler - The Compute Engine Autoscaler adds or removes Google Compute Engine instances to an instance group by interfacing with the group’s manager in response to traffic, CPU utilization, or other signals. In the example solution, the Autoscaler responds to the Request Per Second (RPS) metric of the HTTP load balancer. An Autoscaler is required for each instance group that you want scaled automatically.

Cloud SQL - Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed MySQL database. Replication, encryption, patches, and backups are managed by Google. A Cloud SQL instance is deployed to a single zone, and data is replicated to other zones automatically. 

Cloud Storage - Cloud Storage allows objects (usually files) to be stored and retrieved with a simple and scalable interface.

545,"","What mechanism or strategy does the CHP provide to ensure worldwide data availability as well as comply with data protection regulations / laws in different regions / countries? (Such as the cloud in China is separated from other regions)","Google designs the components of our platform to be highly redundant. This redundancy applies to our server design, how we store data, network and Internet connectivity, and the software services themselves. This “redundancy of everything” includes the handling of errors by design and creates a solution that is not dependent on a single server, data center, or network connection. Google’s data centers are geographically distributed to minimize the effects of regional disruptions on global products such as natural disasters and local outages. In the event of hardware, software, or network failure, platform services and control planes are automatically and instantly shifted from one facility to another so that platform services can continue without interruption . Google’s highly redundant infrastructure also helps customers protect themselves from data loss. Cloud Platform resources can be created and deployed across multiple regions and zones. Allowing customers to build resilient and highly available systems.

Our highly redundant design has allowed Google to achieve an uptime of 99.984% for Gmail for the last years with no scheduled downtime. Simply put, when Google needs to service or upgrade our platform, users do not experience downtime or maintenance windows.

Information on data protection regulations and compliance can be found in our Google Security Whitepaper (https://cloud.google.com/security/whitepaper) and our compliance page (https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance)

Within Google, members of the information security team review security plans for all networks, systems and services. They provide project-specific consulting services to Google’s product and engineering teams. They monitor for suspicious activity on Google’s networks, address information security threats, perform routine security evaluations and audits, and engage outside experts to conduct regular security assessments. We specifically built a full-time team, known as Project Zero, that aims to prevent targeted attacks by reporting bugs to software vendors and filing them in an external database.

The security team also takes part in research and outreach activities to protect the wider community of Internet users, beyond just those who choose Google solutions.

How do you transfer data from one place to another?","All Google Cloud Platform APIs, command lines, and user interfaces fully encrypt data in transit. All network traffic between Google datacenters is encrypted. 

From our security whitepaper:
Data is most vulnerable to unauthorized access as it travels across the Internet or within networks. For this reason, securing data in transit is a high priority for Google. Data traveling between a customer’s device and Google is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS (Transport Layer Security). In fact, Google was the first major cloud provider to enable HTTPS/TLS by default. When sending to or receiving email from a non-Google user, all links of the chain (device, browser, provider of the email service) have to be strong and work together to make encryption work. We believe this is so important that we report on the industry’s adoption of TLS on our safe email site. Google has also upgraded all our RSA certificates to 2048-bit keys, making our encryption in transit for Cloud Platform and all other Google services even stronger. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) minimizes the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough. It protects network data by using a short- term key that lasts only a couple of days and is only held in memory, rather than a key that’s used for years and kept on durable storage. Google was the first major web player to enable perfect forward secrecy by default. Google encrypts Cloud Platform data as it moves between our data centers on our private network.

What is your vulnerability remediation process?","From our security whitepaper on monitoring:

Google’s security monitoring program is focused on information gathered from internal network traffic, employee actions on systems and outside knowledge of vulnerabilities. At many points across our global network, internal traffic is inspected for suspicious behavior, such as the presence of traffic that might indicate botnet connections. This analysis is performed using a combination of open-source and commercial tools for traffic capture and parsing. A proprietary correlation system built on top of Google technology also supports this analysis. Network analysis is supplemented by examining system logs to identify unusual behavior, such as attempted access of customer data. Google security engineers place standing search alerts on public data repositories to look for security incidents that might affect the company’s infrastructure. They actively review inbound security reports and monitor public mailing lists, blog posts, and wikis. Automated network analysis helps determine when an unknown threat may exist and escalates to Google security staff, and network analysis is supplemented by automated analysis of system logs.

From our security whitepaper on incident management:

We have a rigorous incident management process for security events that may affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data. If an incident occurs, the security team logs and prioritizes it according to its severity. Events that directly impact customers are assigned the highest priority. This process specifies courses of action, procedures for notification, escalation, mitigation, and documentation. Google’s security incident management program is structured around the NIST guidance on handling incidents (NIST SP 800–61). Key staff are trained in forensics and handling evidence in preparation for an event, including the use of third-party and proprietary tools. Testing of incident response plans is performed for key areas, such as systems that store sensitive customer information. These tests take into consideration a variety of scenarios, including insider threats and software vulnerabilities. To help ensure the swift resolution of security incidents, the Google security team is available 24/7 to all employees. If an incident involves customer data, Google or its partners will inform the customer and support investigative efforts via our support team.","Cummins - Security","2016-03-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w8KdHd8EXPzgBIM3zZ87aDNs7voNEMfmA4EYnBVcdFk/edit#gid=157555366"

1141,"","Describe the physical security program of the candidate organization","The following is a general description of Google’s various data center environments and efforts to ensure physical security in these environments.

Physical Security Staffing
Google maintains a robust physical security staffing structure to protect its data centers and facilities around the globe. The hub of security operations is the Global Security Operations Center (GSOC), which monitors security alarms, devices, and Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) for every location 24 hours a day, 7 days the week.  The GSOC dispatches security officers at manned sites (including all data centers) to investigate and resolve alarms, concerns and potential risks that arise. The GSOC team also monitors global catastrophes, such as earthquakes and other incidents that may impact on the security and integrity of operations, and organizes emergency response / escalation if necessary.
Google also has a dedicated Investigations group that focuses on incidents that affect Google sites and personnel. The team investigates incidents or violations, tracks patterns, and evaluates threats that may impact the security of Google employees or business operations worldwide.

Physical Security Devices
Data centers employ electronic card key access control system that are linked to a system alarm. Access to perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas is logged, including unauthorized activity.  Failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated as appropriate.  Authorized access throughout the business operations and data centers is restricted based on an individual’s job responsibilities.  The fire doors at the data centers are alarmed and can only be opened from the inside. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centers. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to help cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data center building, and shipping/receiving. Security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment.  Cameras record on site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
The following environmental controls are incorporated into the design of each of Google’s data centers:
Internal and remote temperature and humidity control and monitoring

Smoke detection alarm
Transient voltage surge suppression and grounding
Redundant and backup power systems
Water redundancy or local water reservoirs (for cooling)

To help ensure availability in the event of a disaster, all of the client’s data is replicated to separate systems in different data centers. If a disaster occurred that affected one data center, the client’s data will be served from the secondary data center.  The data between a user’s primary data center and their secondary data center is constantly replicated in real-time. There is nothing that the client or a client employee needs to do to act upon to invoke this. We have built monitoring tools that help look for a malfunction or even slowness in a data center and automatically, push users to their secondary data center.

Google Apps uses the Google File System (GFS), a distributed file system designed to store large amounts of data across thousands of computers.  Data is replicated over multiple systems, so that no one system is a single point of failure.  Each users data is replicated to reside in at least two data centers, that can either serve the user.  These data centers are in different geographic areas, to minimize the impact of a disaster in one region.

This provides for redundancy and data storage to multiple locations within the Google Cloud.  If one location were to become unavailable, the Google file system would continue to process information without data loss because data can be recalled and processed from the multiple locations.  This provides a fault-tolerant system and ensures continually processing if a data center were to be subjected to a catastrophic event.

1227,"Equipment Power Failures","Security mechanisms and redundancies shall be implemented to protect equipment from utility service outages (e.g., power failures, network disruptions, etc.).","Google's data centers are designed for security, resiliency and redundancy. The redundancy is intended to minimize the impact of common equipment failures and environmental risks. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. Critical facilities infrastructure at the data centers have been designed to be robust, fault tolerant and concurrently maintainable. Preventative and corrective maintenance is designed to be performed without interruption of services. Environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the procedure and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer’s or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the Google data center equipment is scheduled through a standard change process.

Power - The data center electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In some cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, is provided for every critical infrastructure component in the data center. This redundancy begins with dual utility power feeds, primary and alternate, to parallel utility switchboards sized so that any one can provide power to the entire facility. The output power is routed to supply building loads including uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), building and mechanical services, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.Backup power is provided by various mechanisms including, but not limited to UPS batteries. Backup power is designed to supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted for any reason, backup power is designed to provide transitory power until the diesel generator systems take over. In the event of unavailability of both electrical utility and diesel generators, backup power can provide emergency electrical power to run the data center at full capacity for up to 10 minutes. Diesel engine generators are in place to provide power to critical equipment and customer loads. The generators are capable of providing enough emergency electrical power to run the data center at full capacity typically for a period of days. These generators automatically startup and are able to provide power within seconds in the event of a power outage.","Google - CCM v2","2013-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_d9DvXUFtTFWuuMa_NgH97z3DLj3fausLdHREqkHoVI/edit#gid=0"

 - Accessible to and understood by those who will use them
 - Owned by a named person(s) who is responsible for their review, update and approval
 - Defined lines of communication, roles and responsibilities
 - Detailed recovery procedures, manual work-around and reference information
 - Method for plan invocation","Google has documented an “Information System Contingency Plan” (ISCP) that governs the scope, responsibility, recovery procedures and contingencies for Google Apps, Google App Engine, Google Apps Script and Google Cloud Storage.  
        
Google conducts Disaster Recovery Testing (DiRT) on an annual basis to provide a coordinated venue for infrastructure and application teams to test communication plans, fail-over scenarios, operational transition, and other emergency responses. The DiRT exercise also tests Google’s ability to sustain Google Apps and other Prod-homed services in the event of a wide-spread outage of Corp infrastructure.","Google - CCM v2","2013-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_d9DvXUFtTFWuuMa_NgH97z3DLj3fausLdHREqkHoVI/edit#gid=0"

1231,"User ID Credentials","Implement and enforce (through automation) user credential and password controls for applications, databases and server and network infrastructure, requiring the following minimum standards:
 - User identity verification prior to password resets.
 - If password reset initiated by personnel other than user (i.e., administrator), password must be immediately changed by user upon first use.
 - Timely access revocation for terminated users.
 - Remove/disable inactive user accounts at least every 90 days.
 - Unique user IDs and disallow group, shared, or generic accounts and passwords.
 - Password expiration at least every 90 days.
 - Minimum password length of at least seven (7) characters.
 - Strong passwords containing both numeric and alphabetic characters.
 - Allow password re-use after the last four (4) passwords used.
 - User ID lockout after not more than si1 (6) attempts.
 - User ID lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until administrator enables the user ID.
 - Re-enter password to reactivate terminal after session idle time for more than 15 minutes.
 - Maintain user activity logs for privileged access or access to sensitive data.","Google has established and enforces strong password policies for all employees and contractors, including password expiration, restrictions on password reuse, and sufficient password strength. Recognizing that even the most complex password is at risk to social engineering, Google makes widespread use of two-factor authentication mechanisms, such as certificates and one-time password generators.  These multifactor authentication techniques provide an additional layer of protection in case the user's password is compromised.

Google also makes use of additional authentication and session protections, such as idle timeout, password re-use prevention, and account lockout in the event of invalid attempts to log in.","Google - CCM v2","2013-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_d9DvXUFtTFWuuMa_NgH97z3DLj3fausLdHREqkHoVI/edit#gid=0"

to information during transmission. Traffic from the Google corporate network to production uses SSH, SSL, or other encrypted means to communicate. Communication sessions are encrypted using SSH or SSL. Within production systems, encrypted channels are used to authenticate and encrypt sessions between machines. 

External authentication traffic between the user’s web browser and Google Authentication uses SSL encryption when users authenticate to their domain. Google uses a version of SSL which implements the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols. Google's SSL implementation uses FIPS validated algorithms, such as AES, and Triple DES.","Google - CCM v2","2013-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_d9DvXUFtTFWuuMa_NgH97z3DLj3fausLdHREqkHoVI/edit#gid=0"
1233,"Application Security","Applications shall be designed in accordance with industry accepted security standards (i.e., OWASP for web applications) and complies with applicable regulatory and business requirements.","Google recognizes that many classes of security concerns arise at the product design level and therefore must be taken into consideration and addressed in the design phase of a product or service. For this reason, such considerations are the primary purpose of the Security Design Review. As such, the Security Design Review has the following objectives:
 - Provide a high-level evaluation of the security risks associated with the project, based on an exploration of relevant threats.
 - Equip the project’s decision makers with the information necessary to make informed risk management decisions and integrate consideration of security into project objectives.
 - Provide guidance on the choice and correct implementation of planned security controls, e.g., authentication protocols or encryption.
 - Help ensure that the development team is adequately educated with regard to relevant classes of vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and appropriate mitigation strategies.

In cases where projects involve innovative features or technologies, it is the Security Team’s responsibility to research and explore security threats, potential attack patterns, and technology-specific vulnerability classes related to such features and technologies.

Where appropriate, Google contracts with third party security consulting firms to complement the Google Security Team’s skill set and to obtain independent third party review to validate in-house security reviews.","Google - CCM v2","2013-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_d9DvXUFtTFWuuMa_NgH97z3DLj3fausLdHREqkHoVI/edit#gid=0"

 - Business and customer requirements
 - Security requirements
 - Compliance with legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements
 - Separation of production and non-production environments
 - Preserve protection and isolation of sensitive data
","An information system boundary of a typical system mainly consists of an inventory of the individual physical devices that comprise the information system. However, since the essence of a cloud computing environment is the replication of single homogenous devices many times over, and because the physical location and number of devices that comprise the infrastructure is dynamic, such a static inventory is not a proper representation of the information system boundary. 

Google employs logical protections and segmentations to protect system boundaries.  All subsystems of Google Apps, App Engine, Apps Script and Cloud Platform enforce access control using ACLs to logically segment customers and application boundaries.  In this way, Google meets customer security requirements, business requirements, legislative and regulatory compliance for the separation and segmentation of system and data access.

1365,"","If a non-user ID cannot meet the following standards:​
 The password must be changed every 30 days. The password must not be embedded into software, login scripts, macros, batch files or JCL.Does the ID address to the following alternate standards?​
• Non-user IDs must be established only for operating system and application processes and not for individual users.
• The principle of least privilege must be followed when assigning access rights to non-user IDs. Restrict the access rights and privileges to only those resources (e.g., files, services, software, data, and tables) necessary for its operation.
• Non-user IDs will not have administrative access to the operating system (e.g., admin equivalence, root)
• A non-user ID must be configured so that it cannot be used to remotely logon to the operating system from a workstation, another server, or directly logon from the server console. For example, a system ID established for a service should have the appropriate privileges to start the service; however, a User must not be able to use that system ID to sign into the server on which the service runs. This requirement is not intended to preclude FTP IDs from remotely logging in using the FTP service; however, FTP IDs must be restricted to logging in using only the FTP service.
• The non-user ID must be restricted so that it cannot logon from anywhere else in the network other than from the system of its intended use (e.g., the non-user ID must originate from a specific network address).

Internal logging: all access of any resource
User logs: events happening in an application or compute instance (e.g. syslog)
Audit logs: immutable log of changes to configuration and/or data

Customers can aggregate and access User logs and Audit logs via the Stackdriver Logging Service, which in turn can send logs data to Google's Analytics as a service engine (BigQuery) or to 3rd party tools like Splunk.

If a non-user ID cannot meet the following standards:
 The password must be changed every 30 days. The password must not be embedded into software, login scripts, macros, batch files or JCL.Does the ID address to the following alternate standards?
• Non-user IDs must be established only for operating system and application processes and not for individual users.
• The principle of least privilege must be followed when assigning access rights to non-user IDs. Restrict the access rights and privileges to only those resources (e.g., files, services, software, data, and tables) necessary for its operation.
• Non-user IDs will not have administrative access to the operating system (e.g., admin equivalence, root) ​
• A non-user ID must be configured so that it cannot be used to remotely logon to the operating system from a workstation, another server, or directly logon from the server console. For example, a system ID established for a service should have the appropriate privileges to start the service; however, a User must not be able to use that system ID to sign into the server on which the service runs. This requirement is not intended to preclude FTP IDs from remotely logging in using the FTP service; however, FTP IDs must be restricted to logging in using only the FTP service.​
• The non-user ID must be restricted so that it cannot logon from anywhere else in the network other than from the system of its intended use (e.g., the non-user ID must originate from a specific network address).
• The non-user ID and password must be stored on a server that resides in a physically secure area.
• The password for a non-user ID must be unique to the environment in which it runs (e.g., Dev,t, QA, and production environments).​
• Access to files (e.g., scripts, configuration files, databases) containing a password must be restricted to the support personnel responsible for managing (e.g., setting up and maintaining) the non-user ID.","N/A.

deployment of its own artifacts and
integrate its deployments with other
service infrastructure?","We have a controlled and fully scripted way to gradually roll out changes and roll changes back as needed. Any developer facing changes (i.e. change the way a core API works) are enabled by releasing a new SDK. The developer chooses to update the SDK in their project and re-deploy the new (or changed API). Back-end changes are often reflected as improved product performance.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"
1839,"","Describe how changes are promoted
from development to QA to production.","PaaS: We treat every application as a “production” application. It is up to you to choose how many applications you want to use. Often companies choose to create at least two versions: one for production and one for UAT. Developers are often allowed to create as many additional applications as needed for their own testing. Since each application provides free quota, these additional applications rarely ever cost any money to run.
For each of these applications, new binaries are deployed with a user definable version identifier (i.e. v2). These new binaries can run side-by-side existing binaries. I.e. “www.crateandbarrel.com” is v1, and “v2.www.crateandbarrel.com” is v2. This allows business users to test and validate a new binary without impacting production traffic. Switching to the new version so thatwww.crateandbarrel.comis v2 is as simple as flipping a switch. It is just as easy to switch back to v1.

Likewise, we also provide easy mechanisms to concurrently run multiple binaries. For example, 50% ofwww.crateandbarrel.comtraffic uses v1 and the other 50% uses v2. This allows easy AB testing.

Most customers leverage continuous integration (“CI”) tools, such ashttp://jenkins-ci.org/to manage the SDLC. This is often set up so each new source code check-in is automatically checked out by the CI system, compiled, and subjected to full Unit Tests. It is then deployed to a “QA” version of the application and additional webdriver tests are executed (such ashttp://seleniumhq.org). This allows full integration testing of new binaries with minimal user intervention. You can leverage hosted CI such ashttp://www.cloudbees.com/which integrates with Google’s Cloud Platform.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"

concurrent projects are managed and
promoted from development to QA to

This allows us to offer a system that is continually improving while minimizing any impact to customers. Many of these features are also exposed directly in our products for customers to leverage as well. For example, it is easy to launch experiments where a percentage of users access different versions of your application so you can test and measure the performance of planned changes without causing a large disruption.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"
1842,"","How rich are the product's features for
establishing trust and fitting with an
overall architecture for trust
management?","Having too many knobs and switches to control the trust management inherently weakens the system as it requires highly specialized skill set to ensure the product is configured correctly.

Google has taken a different approach. Instead of providing all the configuration options to developers and administrators, we have abstracted our core security and trust infrastructure. Each application (PaaS) or project (IaaS) you create has it’s own service accounts that is backed by a PKI infrastructure. We handle the PKI infrastructure as well as certificate rotation so you never have to worry about a certificate expiring. If you want one projects resources to access a different project’s resource, then you can simply assign access to that service account. In the event of PaaS, you can easily pull up the recent public keys by calling “getPublicCertificatesForApp()”.
In IaaS, you are also free to build your own security layers as you see fit.
We also find the lower level PKI integration is a productivity drain on developers, thus provide all delegation through industry leading practice of OAuth 2.0. This allows simple, scoped delegation (i.e. grant application to do X on my behalf) without developers having to deal with any cryptography.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"
1843,"","Describe the architecture including the use of reference architectures, architectural styles, patterns, etc. Include the main architectural goals of the product.","Google addresses computing with a fundamentally different approach. We strive to expose our infrastructure as one logical system rather than a data centers with thousands of systems. This has forced us to rethink how to abstract individual components while providing exceptional performance. Optimizations were developed at every layer in our stack down to our own custom hardware. This is enabling such fast access that people are finding new ways to utilize computing and redirect their resources to higher value tasks.

For example, MapR recently broke several world records on data processing using our virtual machines. The previous records were held using custom build physical hardware. (Google search)

The goal of our products is to provide highly scalable, reliable, fast, and easy to use infrastructure and platform services.

We are happy to hold additional discussions under NDA if needed.

For both the IaaS and PaaS solutions, Google’s approach to scaling is to develop concurrent, parallel executions vs. creating larger and larger single instances.

IaaS, while excellent with existing software packages, shows it’s superior networking and infrastructure in cluster applications such as the MapR example above. Developing architectures that allow for balancing traffic, handling multiple access points to data and being inherently capable of single/multiple instance failures are optimized by Google’s core technology.

Google’s PaaS solution is designed best around stateless, quick, small packets of work. There are stateful solutions on the PaaS where needed but the prevailing design philosophy is to use short, stateless services and enable queues and other asynchronous mechanisms to maintain system response times and quick fail-over.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"

Google Compute Engine supports the ability to launch Linux VMs taking advantage of dedicated computing resources isolated from other GCE customers. It also supports persistent block devices for making standard I/O system calls with Linux device files along with full control over VM configuration.
Google Compute Engine offers three types of encrypted storage that can be attached on-demand to VMs:
1) Ephemeral disk, a simple block device bound to the span in which a VM instance is run. I.e. Once the VM is stopped, all data is lost
2) Persistent disk, a network-connected storage device with high redundancy that is replicated across at least 2 Google data centers. GCE users also have the ability to create snapshots of persistent disks for backup/restore operations. Each VM can be configured to read from a single persistent disk or numerous VMs can read from a single disk.
3) Google Cloud Storage, a highly scalable and performant object storage service that can also be used standalone by customers of the Cloud Platform.
Compute Engine provides network capabilities to connect to other VMs as well as to external Internet sources using a static IP address or an ephemeral IP address.
New VMs must be launched through the compute admin utilities or through a third-party management tool such as Rightscale where auto-scaling based on server demand can be configured.
PaaS:
Google’s PaaS solution, Google App Engine, provides application virtualization layered on top of machine virtualization (as in Compute Engine) allowing for computing resources to be auto-scaled real-time for a deployed application. Applications deployed to App Engine are completely independent from the virtual machine it runs on and multitenancy is supported through process isolation. New application nodes are created automatically based on resource usage. The PaaS solution abstracts all layers of the infrastructure up to application logic deployed by customers.
The following is a diagram showing the continuum from hosting your own server up to Google’s PaaS solution.

Some competitor solutions are only able to virtualize their PaaS system to being able to spin up an IaaS pre-configured system then deploy application assets onto the infrastructure. This still contains an IaaS bend and means that the customer is still handling many aspects of the solution and not virtualized. While this “application on IaaS” is superior to raw IaaS for application deployments the integrated benefits of Google’s PaaS having multiple core services, reduced memory/processing footprint because of not executing middleware or operating system concerns, and server/data center/region flexibility is missed.
Google’s PaaS virtualization is region aware but does not require any further fine grained definition. Concepts such as data centers, availability zones, local regions, are not required.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"
1845,"","Describe the product’s capabilities to recover user sessions and system services in the event of failure. (e.g. failures in hardware, software, networks, or a loss of power)","IAAS:
Google Compute Engine provides the necessary infrastructure to deploy clustered software solutions that provide failover capability.

Compute Engine persistent storage is automatically backed up within a datacenter as well as across data centers to provide failure recovery.

Software HTTP load balancers can be used for failover between running VMs. In addition, fully integrated infrastructure management software such as Rightscale can be used to create new VMs real-time in the event a VM is not available to process a request.

PAAS:
To handle application tier failover, Google App Engine stores user sessions in memory as well as in it’s integrated datastore to handle application node failovers. Session persistence can be configured to be synchronous or asynchronous (for performance) based on usage needs. User sessions not found in cache after a failover will be retrieved from persistent storage.
Google App Engine handles HTTP load balancing internally for new user sessions and for stateless web services.

All writes to the datastore are synchronously written to at least 3 data centers, facilitating fail-over without any data loss.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"

Organization: Establishing a centralized SOA team tasked with defining policies and SOA lifecycle processes SOA Lifecycle Management: Processes for scope definition, design, development, deployment, and retirement Policy Enforcement: Creation of controls and audits to ensure governance policies are followed throughout organization Security: Establishing security policies and controls Operational management: Tools and processes used to monitor SLA’s and QoS metrics for deployed services
Maven Wave’s leaders have helped several clients establish successful SOA governance programs from upfront strategy definition to the development of custom interface compliance auditing tools.

In terms of compatibility with SOA governance software frameworks, services deployed to Google App Engine or Compute Engine are built using widely adopted standards (REST/XML, REST/JSON, or SOAP) that can easily be integrated into a central service registry or a SOA governance product of choice.

Google application consumes external service:
If external web services are exposed to the internet, Compute Engine solutions can consume them without any special configuration. For external services hosted behind a firewall where a VPN connection is required, a Compute Engine proxy server and installed VPN client can be used to make web service requests.

External application consumes Google service:
External applications can connect to web applications hosted on Compute Engine via a static IP address. Web services are deployed to Compute Engine on any web server that can run on Linux.

PaaS:
For outbound communication to external services, Google App Engine provides a “UrlFetch” library that can be used to send any message payload over HTTPS. The interface supports standard web service protocols (REST/XML, REST/JSON, and SOAP).

Google App Engine services can be consumed using standard HTTPS web service protocols exposed to the internet or through a messaging framework called Task Queues. Task Queues can be used for bidirectional asynchronous communication with external applications. External clients can poll the queues for messages at customized intervals. Communication with the queue is over HTTPS.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"

Each application (PaaS) or project (IaaS) you create has it’s own service accounts that is backed by a PKI infrastructure. We handle the PKI infrastructure as well as certificate rotation so you never have to worry about a certificate expiring. If you want one projects resources to access a different project’s resource, then you can simply assign access to that service account.

Network
Stores a lookup table that tracks every active connection. When a packet arrives that is part of an active connection, it will be sent to the destination without consulting any other firewall rules. Stores a lookup table that associates external IP addresses with instances. All packets to the external IP are routed to the network, which looks up the internal IP corresponding to that address, and forwards it to the instance. Performs MAC address lookups (proxy ARP) for a given IP address. Routes packets between instances on the same network. Routes packets externally (billing involved).…
Who Handles What
Under the covers, different networking features are handled by different parts of the Google Compute Engine system. Some of these are standard networking features that are well documented, and some of them are specific to Google Compute Engine. Some features you can configure, and some you cannot. Google Compute Engine uses Linux'sVIRTIO network moduleto model Ethernet card and router functionality, but higher levels of the networking stack, such as ARP lookups, are handled using standard networking software.
ARP lookup The instance kernel issues ARP requests; the Network issues ARP replies. The mapping between MAC addresses and IP addresses is handled by the instance kernel.

Snippits fromhttps://developers.google.com/compute/docs/overview#firewallresource:

Firewall Resource
A Firewall resource contains one or more rules that permit connections into instances. Every firewall resource is associated with one and only one network. It is not possible to associate one firewall with multiple networks.
No communication is allowed into an instance unless a Firewall resource permits the network traffic, even between instances on the same network. However, an instance is always allowed to communicate out, unless it is trying to communicate through one of theblocked traffic sources. In other words, firewalls only apply to incoming connections. A firewall resource consists of:
A set of allowed sources. This can either be explicit IP address ranges or a set of instances defined by a tag on the instance. A set of target VMs, defined by tags on the instances A set of protocols and portsWith these primitives, Google Compute Engine provides a flexible configuration to allow connections from any source or to any target. To get started, here are some firewall examples:
A firewall that allows incoming TCP connections to port 80 and 443 on instances tagged 'frontend' from anywhere. A firewall that allows SSH requests into any instance from just your workstation's IP. A firewall that allows all TCP or UDP requests from instances labeled ""frontend"" to any instances labeled ""backend"" over port 118.For more information, seeNetworking and Firewalls.","Crate & Barrel","2013-08-01","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6iyxGlOXgoYjk9XFU6J4Rv5bpo-oQcXQQR-04EsCVc"

To keep data private and secure, Google logically isolates each customer’s Cloud Platform data from that of other customers and users, even when it’s stored on the same physical server. Only a small group of Google employees have access to customer data. For Google employees, access rights and levels are based on their job function and role, using the concepts of least-privilege and need-to-know to match access privileges to defined responsibilities. Google employees are only granted a limited set of default permissions to access company resources, such as employee email and Google’s internal employee portal. Requests for additional access follow a formal process that involves a request and an approval from a data or system owner, manager, or other executives, as dictated by Google’s security policies. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. These tools control both the modification of authorization settings and the approval process to ensure consistent application of the approval policies. An employee’s authorization settings are used to control access to all resources, including data and systems for Cloud Platform products. Support services are only provided to authorized customer administrators whose identities have been verified in several ways. Googler access is monitored and audited by our dedicated security, privacy, and internal audit teams.","Monsanto","2016-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5tRBZJCslSdxpAZmfeufEZ5zgcB334A40Z9TnCBrfU"

Unlike much commercially available hardware, Google servers don't include unnecessary components such as video cards, chipsets, or peripheral connectors, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Our production servers run a custom-designed operating system (OS) based on a stripped-down and hardened version of Linux. Google’s servers and their OS are designed for the sole purpose of providing Google services. Server resources are dynamically allocated, allowing for flexibility in growth and the ability to adapt quickly and efficiently, adding or reallocating resources based on customer demand. This homogeneous environment is maintained by proprietary software that continually monitors systems for binary modifications.

Our production servers run a custom-designed operating system (OS) based on a stripped-down and hardened version of Linux. Google’s servers and their OS are designed for the sole purpose of providing Google services. Server resources are dynamically allocated, allowing for flexibility in growth and the ability to adapt quickly and efficiently, adding or reallocating resources based on customer demand. This homogeneous environment is maintained by proprietary software that continually monitors systems for binary modifications. If a modification is found that differs from the standard Google image, the system is automatically returned to its official state. These automated, self-healing mechanisms are designed to enable Google to monitor and remediate destabilizing events, receive notifications about incidents, and slow down potential compromise on the network.","Monsanto","2016-06-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5tRBZJCslSdxpAZmfeufEZ5zgcB334A40Z9TnCBrfU"

Data is most vulnerable to unauthorized access as it travels across the Internet or within networks. For this reason, securing data in transit is a high priority for Google. Data traveling between a customer’s device and Google is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS (Transport Layer Security). In fact, Google was the first major cloud provider to enable HTTPS/TLS by default. When sending to or receiving email from a non-Google user, all links of the chain (device, browser, provider of the email service) have to be strong and work together to make encryption work. We believe this is so important that we report on the industry’s adoption of TLS on our safe email site. Google has also upgraded all our RSA certificates to 2048-bit keys, making our encryption in transit for Cloud Platform and all other Google services even stronger. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) minimizes the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough. It protects network data by using a short- term key that lasts only a couple of days and is only held in memory, rather than a key that’s used for years and kept on durable storage. Google was the first major web player to enable perfect forward secrecy by default.

An effective malware attack can lead to account compromise, data theft, and possibly additional access to a network. Google takes these threats to its networks and its customers very seriously and uses a variety of methods to prevent, detect and eradicate malware. Google helps tens of millions of people every day to protect themselves from harm by showing warnings to users of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari when they attempt to navigate to websites that would steal their personal information or install software designed to take over their computers. Malware sites or email attachments install malicious software on users’ machines to steal private information, perform identity theft, or attack other computers. When people visit these sites, software that takes over their computer is downloaded without their knowledge. Google’s malware strategy begins with infection prevention by using manual and automated scanners to scour Google’s search index for websites that may be vehicles for malware or phishing. Approximately one billion people use Google’s Safe Browsing on a regular basis. Google’s Safe Browsing technology examines billions of URLs per day looking for unsafe websites. Every day, we discover thousands of new unsafe sites, many of which are legitimate websites that have been compromised. When we detect unsafe sites, we show warnings on Google Search and in web browsers. In addition to our Safe Browsing solution, Google operates VirusTotal, a free online service that analyzes files and URLs enabling the identification of viruses, worms, trojans and other kinds of malicious content detected by antivirus engines and website scanners. VirusTotal’s mission is to help in improving the antivirus and security industry and make the Internet a safer place through the development of free tools and services.

They provide project-specific consulting services to Google’s product and engineering teams. They monitor for suspicious activity on Google’s networks, address information security threats, perform routine security evaluations and audits, and engage outside experts to conduct regular security assessments. We specifically built a full-time team, known as Project Zero, that aims to prevent targeted attacks by reporting bugs to software vendors and filing them in an external database.

For example, when Heartbleed was first discovered in 2014, Google was able to patch all our infrastructure before the disclosure was made public. We are very serious on security issues on our platform.

For customer-managed virtual machines, we also publish security advisory bulletin

3. An effective malware attack can lead to account compromise, data theft, and possibly additional access to a network. Google takes these threats to its
networks and its customers very seriously and uses a variety of methods to prevent, detect and eradicate malware. Google helps tens of millions of people
every day to protect themselves from harm by showing warnings to users of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari when they attempt to navigate
to websites that would steal their personal information or install software designed to take over their computers. Malware sites or email attachments
install malicious software on users’ machines to steal private information, perform identity theft, or attack other computers. When people visit these sites,
software that takes over their computer is downloaded without their knowledge. Google’s malware strategy begins with infection prevention by using manual and
automated scanners to scour Google’s search index for websites that may be vehicles for malware or phishing. Approximately one billion people use Google’s Safe Browsing on a regular basis. Google’s Safe Browsing technology examines billions of URLs per day looking for unsafe websites. Every day, we discover thousands of new unsafe sites, many of which are legitimate websites that have been compromised. When we detect unsafe sites, we show warnings on Google
Search and in web browsers. In addition to our Safe Browsing solution, Google operates VirusTotal, a free online service that analyzes files and URLs enabling
the identification of viruses, worms, trojans and other kinds of malicious content detected by antivirus engines and website scanners. VirusTotal’s mission is to
help in improving the antivirus and security industry and make the Internet a safer place through the development of free tools and services.

5.  All traffic is routed through custom GFE (Google Front End) servers to detect and stop malicious requests and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

How does Google perform data validation, and in what cases is data validation in use for GCP applications?","Google technical infrastructure is built upon many different layers of abstractions. At each layer, data must be valid for the next layer to operate successfully. These include, but are not limited to, striping, replication, encryption. Data integrity is at the core components of a functional platform.

Google’s highly redundant infrastructure also helps protect our customers from data loss. For the Google Cloud Platform, our recovery point objective (RPO) target is zero, and our recovery time objective (RTO) design target is also zero. We aim to achieve these targets through live or synchronous replication: Google’s data centers are geographically distributed to minimize the effects of regional disruptions such as natural disasters and local outages. Actions you take in GCP are simultaneously replicated in two data centers at once, so that if one data center fails, we transfer your data over to the other one that’s also been reflecting your actions.

We are talking about items that are resident in memory or written to a shared hard drive.","When shared resources such as memory or custom storage are released, these elements are wiped per industry standards.

Before it's stored, all data is broken up into smaller chunks and spread across Google’s servers, and identified by a unique ID. Each chunk of data is encrypted with a different encryption key. The data encryption key (DEK) is wrapped with a key encryption key (KEK). The wrapped DEK is stored next to the data chunk. Key encryption keys (KEK) are stored in Google’s Keystore, which is the same system used for all of Google’s production keys. Each data chunk has an ACL and access to that data is managed by the storage service. Keystore checks requests to unwrap keys from both individuals and services. Keystore logs requests to unwrap keys from both individuals and services.","UC Denver","2016-05-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEhSrfVXpfKv7F84wDoRNFR1mlZ7Fv-sCqSXQsO-UB4"
3235,"","1. How does your cloud platform protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data? This includes data transmitted internally and externally. I'm assuming that all data sent is encrypted? If so, can you provide the technology and strength used?","Data is most vulnerable to unauthorized access as it travels across the Internet or within networks. For this reason, securing data in transit is a high priority for Google. Data traveling between a customer’s device and Google is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS (Transport Layer Security). In fact, Google was the first major cloud provider to enable HTTPS/TLS by default. When sending to or receiving email from a non-Google user, all links of the chain (device, browser, provider of the email service) have to be strong and work together to make encryption work. We believe this is so important that we report on the industry’s adoption of TLS on our safe email site. Google has also upgraded all our RSA certificates to 2048-bit keys, making our encryption in transit for Cloud Platform and all other Google services even stronger. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) minimizes the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough. It protects network data by using a short- term key that lasts only a couple of days and is only held in memory, rather than a key that’s used for years and kept on durable storage. Google was the first major web player to enable perfect forward secrecy by default. Google encrypts Cloud Platform data as it moves between our data centers on our private network.

Data Transmission. Data centers are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centers. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during electronic transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.

External Attack Surface. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.

Intrusion Detection. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google intrusion detection involves:

tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;
employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and
employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.
Incident Response. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.

Encryption Technologies. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS connection) available.","UC Denver","2016-05-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEhSrfVXpfKv7F84wDoRNFR1mlZ7Fv-sCqSXQsO-UB4"

An interaction with Keystore is required to unwrap it for later use. Access and authorization to Keystore are checked and logged.","UC Denver","2016-05-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEhSrfVXpfKv7F84wDoRNFR1mlZ7Fv-sCqSXQsO-UB4"

All staff with access to production systems are trained in these policies prior to gaining access to systems.

Google’s focus on security and protection of data is among our primary design criteria. Google data center physical security features a layered security model, including safeguards like custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics, and the data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection. Our data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders. Access logs, activity records, and camera footage are available in case an incident occurs. Data centers are also routinely patrolled by experienced security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training. As you get closer to the data center floor, security measures also increase. Access to the data center floor is only possible via a security corridor which implements multi-factor access control using security badges and biometrics. Only approved employees with specific roles may enter. Less than one percent of Googlers will ever set foot in one of our data centers.

Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations. 

Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role (eg., certifications).

Only a small group of Google employees have access to customer data. For Google employees, access rights and levels are based on their job function and role, using the concepts of least-privilege and need-to-know to match access privileges to defined responsibilities. Google employees are only granted a limited set of default permissions to access company resources, such as employee email and Google’s internal employee portal. Requests for additional access follow a formal process that involves a request and an approval from a data or system owner, manager, or other executives, as dictated by Google’s security policies. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. These tools control both the modification of authorization settings and the approval process to ensure consistent application of the approval policies. An employee’s authorization settings are used to control access to all resources, including data and systems for Cloud Platform products. Support services are only provided to authorized customer administrators whose identities have been verified in several ways. Googler access is monitored and audited by our dedicated security, privacy, and internal audit teams.

Within customer organizations, administrative roles and privileges for Google Cloud Platform are configured and controlled by the project owner.

Google Compute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering that allows for users to deploy 10 or 10,000 VM containers in a matter of seconds.  Today, you can host any Linux application and be sure that it will be able to scale and run with predictable performance.

Google Compute Engine lets you run large-scale computing workloads on the same infrastructure that runs Google Search, Gmail and Ads. You can launch virtual machines on-demand, manage network connectivity using a simple but flexible networking solution and access a variety of data storage alternative from your virtual machines.  The consumption-based pricing allows you to scale as needed and not pay up-front deployment or procurement costs.

Google App Engine (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
Google App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service offering that allows for highly customized application development removing constraints applied by on-premise hardware such as individual server installation, configuration, and management. App Engine’s core platform attributes include:
- Massive scalability
- Fault tolerance
- Services charged that are consumed

App Engine is built to be scalable to the largest processing and traffic needs the Internet can offer. This scaling allows for easy tuning of services to meet increases in demand. App Engine is ideal for occasional large traffic spikes while not requiring peak load infrastructure investment.

App Engine is deployed across Google’s network. This gives applications redundancy across many data centers and also allows traffic to be routed to the nearest available instances decreasing latency. This approach also provides high fault tolerance and provides redundancy to applications within the platform. App Engine is able to achieve very high SLA compliance through these mechanisms.

Using a pay-as-you-go scheme, App Engine allows a company’s software solution to scale when needed and not pay for spare capacity when processing is not being performed. App Engine’s pricing gets very specific on resources consumed but will lead to decreased operational costs by not acquiring and managing peak load requirements of infrastructure.","Under Armour","2015-08-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v9dw8ro3FpEPwKL9vggpt_gCGm29f1H7RUobhEfaPqg"

Memcache (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/memcache/)
High performance scalable web applications often use a distributed in-memory data cache in front of or in place of robust persistent storage for some tasks. App Engine includes a memory cache service for this purpose.

Bigquery (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
Google’s large dataset analytic solution is BigQuery. This service allows SQL-like queries to run against very large datasets possibly with billions of rows. The system is scalable to accommodate massive scale datasets with quick response times. BigQuery is able to handle terabytes of data comprising billions of rows in seconds. The system is optimized with Google technology to leverage parallel processing on Google’s infrastructure to respond quickly and securely to queries.

Bigtable (https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/)
Google Cloud Bigtable offers you a fast, fully managed, massively scalable NoSQL database service that's ideal for web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications requiring terabytes to petabytes of data. Unlike comparable market offerings, Cloud Bigtable doesn't require you to sacrifice speed, scale, or cost efficiency when your applications grow.

Google Cloud Storage (https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
Google Cloud Storage offers developers and IT organizations durable and highly available object storage. Google created three simple product options to help you address the needs of your applications while keeping your costs low. These three product options use the same API, providing you with a simple and consistent method of access.

Google Cloud Durable Reduced Availability Storage(https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/durable-reduced-availability)
DRA storage is appropriate for storing data that is particularly cost-sensitive, or for which a lower number of back-ups is acceptable. For example:
- Data backup - Where high durability is critical, but the highest availability is not required.
- Batch jobs - Batch jobs can recover from unavailable data, for example by keeping track of the last object that was processed and resuming from that point upon restarting.

Google Nearline Storage(https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/nearline)
Google Cloud Storage Nearline is a low-cost, highly-durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery. Data is available in seconds, not hours or days. With ~3 second response times and 1 cent per GB/month pricing, Cloud Storage Nearline gives you the best performance at the lowest cost.

Nearline Storage is a better choice over Standard Storage in scenarios where slightly lower availability and slightly higher latency (typically just a few seconds) is an acceptable trade-off for lowered storage costs. For example:
- Cold Data Storage - Infrequently accessed data, such as data stored for legal or regulatory reasons, can be stored at low cost as Nearline Storage, and be available when you need it.
- Disaster recovery - In the event of a disaster recovery event, recovery time is key. Google Cloud Storage provides low latency access to data stored as Nearline Storage.","Under Armour","2015-08-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v9dw8ro3FpEPwKL9vggpt_gCGm29f1H7RUobhEfaPqg"

Google’s Security Philosophy is also outlined at the following page: http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/security.html.
The foundation of Google’s commitment to security is its set of security policies that cover physical, account, data, corporate services, network and computer systems, applications services, systems services, change management, incident response, and data center security. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis to help ensure their continued effectiveness and accuracy.
In addition to these security policies, with which all persons employed by Google must comply, employees are also given a Security Primer. This document outlines the most important aspects of information security policy, such as the safe use of the Internet, working from remote locations safely, and how to label and handle sensitive data. Additional guidance is routinely given on policy topics of interest, especially in areas of emerging technology, such as the safe use of mobile devices and peer-to-peer software. These supplemental policy documents are written with Google’s core ideology of simplicity in mind, knowing that written policies are only effective if their information is consumed.

This commitment is outlined in the Google Code of Conduct, which is posted on Google’s website at http://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html. Google’s Security Philosophy is also outlined at the following page: http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/security.html.
The foundation of Google’s commitment to security is its set of security policies that cover physical, account, data, corporate services, network and computer systems, applications services, systems services, change management, incident response, and data center security. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis to help ensure their continued effectiveness and accuracy.
In addition to these security policies, with which all persons employed by Google must comply, employees are also given a Security Primer. This document outlines the most important aspects of information security policy, such as the safe use of the Internet, working from remote locations safely, and how to label and handle sensitive data. Additional guidance is routinely given on policy topics of interest, especially in areas of emerging technology, such as the safe use of mobile devices and peer-to-peer software. These supplemental policy documents are written with Google’s core ideology of simplicity in mind, knowing that written policies are only effective if their information is consumed.

If an incident occurs, the security team logs and prioritizes it according to
its severity. Events that directly impact customers are assigned the highest
priority. This process specifies courses of action, procedures for notification,
escalation, mitigation, and documentation. Google’s security incident
management program is structured around the NIST guidance on handling
incidents (NIST SP 800–61). Key staff are trained in forensics and handling
evidence in preparation for an event, including the use of third-party and
proprietary tools. Testing of incident response plans is performed for key
areas, such as systems that store sensitive customer information.
These tests take into consideration a variety of scenarios, including insider
threats and software vulnerabilities. To help ensure the swift resolution
of security incidents, the Google security team is available 24/7 to all
employees. If an incident involves customer data, Google or its partners will
inform the customer and support investigative efforts via our support team.","Under Armour","2015-08-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v9dw8ro3FpEPwKL9vggpt_gCGm29f1H7RUobhEfaPqg"

design criteria. Google data center physical security features a layered
security model, including safeguards like custom-designed electronic access
cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors,
and biometrics, and the data center floor features laser beam intrusion
detection. Our data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior
and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders. Access logs, activity records, and
camera footage are available in case an incident occurs. Data centers are also routinely patrolled
by experienced security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training.
As you get closer to the data center floor, security measures also increase. Access to the data
center floor is only possible via a security corridor which implements multifactor access control

This commitment is outlined in the Google Code of Conduct, which is posted on Google’s website at http://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html. Google’s Security Philosophy is also outlined at the following page: http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/security.html.
The foundation of Google’s commitment to security is its set of security policies that cover physical, account, data, corporate services, network and computer systems, applications services, systems services, change management, incident response, and data center security. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis to help ensure their continued effectiveness and accuracy.
In addition to these security policies, with which all persons employed by Google must comply, employees are also given a Security Primer. This document outlines the most important aspects of information security policy, such as the safe use of the Internet, working from remote locations safely, and how to label and handle sensitive data. Additional guidance is routinely given on policy topics of interest, especially in areas of emerging technology, such as the safe use of mobile devices and peer-to-peer software. These supplemental policy documents are written with Google’s core ideology of simplicity in mind, knowing that written policies are only effective if their information is consumed.

Explain.","Yes Google’s security monitoring program is focused on information gathered
from internal network traffic, employee actions on systems and outside
knowledge of vulnerabilities. At many points across our global network,
internal traffic is inspected for suspicious behavior, such as the presence
of traffic that might indicate botnet connections. This analysis is performed
using a combination of open-source and commercial tools for traffic
capture and parsing. A proprietary correlation system built on top of Google
technology also supports this analysis. Network analysis is supplemented
by examining system logs to identify unusual behavior, such as attempted
access of customer data. Google security engineers place standing search
alerts on public data repositories to look for security incidents that might
affect the company’s infrastructure. They actively review inbound security
reports and monitor public mailing lists, blog posts, and wikis. Automated
network analysis helps determine when an unknown threat may exist and
escalates to Google security staff, and network analysis is supplemented by
automated analysis of system logs.","Under Armour","2015-08-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v9dw8ro3FpEPwKL9vggpt_gCGm29f1H7RUobhEfaPqg"

A note about security and firewalls: Google offers the most hardened public cloud in the world. With Google Cloud Platform you get to take advantage of our significant investment in security so you can focus on what’s really important: investing in innovation. Google's network offers DDOS protection, WAF, over 450 security engineers. Google security engineers discovered Heartbleed and POODLE, two of the most recent and most significant threats to online security. Google was the first to start a reward program for reporting vulnerabilities and the first company that Implemented encryption everywhere and SSL by default at Google. Our data centers are in remote locations which are restricted to only Google employees who operate the datacenter -- even I can’t visit.  Our controls include alarm systems, cameras, and security guards. Google’s facilities use high resolution cameras with video analytics to detect and track intruders. Additional security controls such as thermal imaging cameras, perimeter fences, laser detectors, and biometrics -- like retina scans. In the data center we run tens of thousands of identical systems -- and we build those servers ourselves.  In fact Google is one of the top 5 server manufacturers worldwide by volume.  We've built everything from hardware, networking, to the custom Linux software stack with security in mind. Google Cloud Platform is PCI Compliant, HIPAA Compliant, SOC 1, 2, and 3 Compliant, and ISO 27001 certified. And because we ensure that our platform is compliant, this actually saves you both time and money.  When we talk with customers they estimate spending at least $50 / per server just on compliance costs.

3454,"","Do you support SQL replication both within a single datacenter and between disparate data centers?  If there is a fee for these services, what is the pricing schedule?","We offer Google Cloud SQL. When creating a Google Cloud SQL instance, you can choose to enable synchronous or asynchronous replication for your data. In either case, your data is replicated in multiple zones within the US, EU, or Asia regions. This is equivalent to taking a backup of any updates to your data as they happen. This means that in the very unlikely event of a complete failure of a zone, your data will be preserved. There is no monitor cost difference in choosing synchronous or asynchronous replication because replication is not a charged feature. 

All Cloud SQL data is replicated in multiple zones. In the unlikely event of a zone outage, instances fail over to another, available, zone automatically. Failover is designed to be transparent to your applications, so that after failover, an instance has the same instance name, IP address, and firewall rules. During the failover there will typically be a few seconds downtime as the instance transitions to the new zone. However, please note that in some cases, the InnoDB crash-recovery process may take longer, delaying the time before the instance is up.

Additionally Google Cloud SQL ​provides a means to restore from a backup and perform a point-in-time recovery to specific state of an instance. Google retains up to 7 backups for each instance, which is included in the cost of your instance. For more info, please see https://cloud.google.com/sql/. For pricing, please see https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/ and click on the blue icon for Google Cloud SQL. 

For MySQL, you can run it on Google Compute Engine Virtual Machines. Additionally, we offer a 1-click to deploy solution for Percona, which is a solution for MySQL or MariaDB clustering. Moreover, Google Cloud Platform's Solutions team can provide instructions and scripts for using Galera, another SQL clustering solution should your architecture require SQL clustering. You can also 1-click to deploy a traditional LAMP stack. 

Additionally, Microsoft SQL Server runs very well on Google Compute Engine virtual machines running Windows 2008 R2. 

For running MySQL on Google Compute Engine, there's no additional fees beyond what you would pay for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

If you're considering a NoSQL option, Google offers the Google Cloud Datastore. Datastore is schemaless, autoscales, and is fully managed. For more info, please see https://cloud.google.com/datastore/.

3491,"","What components can be monitored within PaaS?","StackDriver provides monitoring for performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. Stackdriver collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others. Stackdriver ingests that data and generates insights via dashboards, charts, and alerts. Stackdriver alerting helps you collaborate by integrating with Slack, PagerDuty, HipChat, Campfire, and more.

Examples of metrics monitored by Google Cloud Monitoring include CPU utilization, request processing latency, amount of storage consumed, and so forth. Metrics are qualified by resource--for example, the CPU utilization of VM instance A, the request processing latency in web server B, the amount of storage used by project C, and so forth. When a metric is measured over time, it produces a time series of data. Each Google Cloud offering such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud SQL provides a set of metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring and you can also define custom metrics to measure any aspect of your system. Custom metrics might include cart checkouts, user logins, or business KPIs.

Custom dashboards can display of charts and other information such as event logs and incident lists. Dashboards are organized in a single page view and can show a snapshot of your system's overall health or show specific information about factors influencing that health. 

Cloud Monitoring also provides uptime checks and event monitoring. Uptime checks periodically send requests to your applications, services, or URLs from various locations around the world. You can use the results of the checks as conditions in your alert policies, so you will be notified if system health is degraded. An event log is a time-ordered list of system events related to your application and to the platforms and services it uses. Examples of events include downtime of the cloud infrastructure, notifications related to your alert policy, and code deployments. 

Cloud Monitoring enables the creation of alert policies--a set of rules that determine whether your resources or groups are operating normally. The rules are logical conditions involving metric thresholds and uptime checks. For example, you can create a rule that your web site's average response latency must not exceed five seconds over a period of two minutes. When an alert policy's conditions are met an incident appears in the Incidents section of the Cloud Monitoring Console. Incidents remain open until the alert policy rules are no longer in violation or until the incident is manually closed. You can associate notifications with alert policies. For example, alerts can send email or SMS notifications to people or services.

You can use this condition type to monitor many different metrics and fine tune exactly when you’d like to be notified.
Rate of Change Conditions
A rate of change condition can be configured to alert you when any metric increases or decreases by a certain rate in a specific period of time (ex. alert me when the latency on my load balancer grows by more than 50% in a 15-minute period). A 10-minute moving average is applied to the metric to reduce sensitivity to short spikes. You can use this condition type to monitor many different metrics and fine tune exactly when you’d like to be notified.

Monitoring a metric’s absence will help to do things like confirm that Cloudwatch is up and running or make sure your agent is working properly. By watching for the absence of data from vital metrics in your environment, you can essentially monitor the “heartbeat” of your system.

Group Aggregate Metric Threshold
Use this condition type to set threshold alerts on aggregate metrics for clusters.

The following aggregate functions are available for use in your configurations:

Average
Sum
Min
Max
Median
Standard deviation
95th percentile
5th percentile
You may want to set basic boundaries across clusters for metrics such as average CPU, Memory or Disk I/O (example: alert me if average memory usage across my cluster surpasses 80%).

You can also keep an eye on variance by alerting on a change in standard deviation for a metric across a cluster. This will provide some warning when a cluster is not running within its normal operating boundaries (example: my cassandra cluster normally has a standard deviation of 5% CPU so alert me if that rises above 7% for 1 hour).

Process Health
You can configure process health alerts to to let you know when there are too many or too few processes running on an instance or group of instances. Configuration allows for use of regular expressions to select applicable process names as well as the optional constraint for which user the process should be running under.

The maintenance-event attribute will be updated before and after an event, allowing you to detect when these events are imminent. You can use this information to help automate any scripts or commands you want to run before and/or after a maintenance event. For more information, see the Transparent maintenance notice documentation.  

Google also provides Live Migration https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-instance-scheduling-options#live_migrate where Google Compute Engine automatically migrates your instance away from an infrastructure maintenance event, and your instance remains running during the migration.

https://cloud.google.com/security/
https://cloud.google.com/security/whitepaper

Security control responsibility is clearly defined and enforced across parties through monitored SLAs and implementation and effectiveness of these controls is regularly audited. 

However, Deloitte's IT SOX/SOD controls approach leverages our methodology as well as our experience in assisting clients like you with the design and implementation of Business SOX controls for your PaaS environment, as required by your internal policies and IT controls. And, our Application Risk Monitoring solutions enable visibility into the risk posture of critical applications and business processes, and improve security practices in the application development lifecycle. Specifically our Secure Software Enablement Services provide our clients with an integrated, managed service solution to enable the design, development, and deployment of secure applications and systems.

Deloitte’s Information Security, Risk & Compliance (IRC) is a centralized organization with security, privacy policy and controls covering all Deloitte’s global entities. Offshore development centers in India fall under U.S. centralized policies and controls. IRC formulates, periodically updates security policies for project teams to comply with as part of serving clients.

Deloitte security and compliance framework essentially integrates multiple facets of security-physical, personal, process, compliance and data. Using a proprietary framework to measure and monitor risk will allow us to focus on areas of remediation required during every phase of the program.  Key areas may include data classification, security vulnerabilities, interface design and data transfer privacy risks.  We will leverage segments of this framework as we execute the different threads of our proposed solution by considering key Industry Standards (COBIT, COSO, ISO27799, and HITRUST).  The framework considers the following information technology domains as it relates to this project: IS policy and compliance management, identify and access management, information asset management, threat and vulnerability management, security awareness and training, business continuity management, security program management, data protection and privacy, 3rd party security and security operations.

Lastly, Deloitte has the world’s leading business and technology risk consultancy. Cyber risk is more than a technology issue and more than just security. It is a first order business risk.

3712,"","Has your Company implemented a written Incident Response Procedure to identify, consistently report and resolve any known or suspected security or privacy problems, incidents or breaches?","Yes Google has an incident management process for security events that may affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of its systems or data. This process specifies courses of action, procedures for notification, escalation, mitigation, and documentation.  To help ensure the swift resolution of security incidents, the Google information security team is available 24x7 to all Google employees.
In addition, Google proactively searches for security incidents on an ongoing basis, by actively reviewing inbound security reports, monitoring public mailing lists and blog posts, and tracking automated perimeter systems. When an information security incident occurs, Google’s security staff responds promptly in a manner commensurate with the threat level. Notification of the incident may be generated automatically by Google’s monitoring systems or manually by a Google employee.
Google works closely with the security community to track reported issues in Google services and open source tools. ","Pfizer","2016-07-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pQqTvrAoFK_whJypsw1f3E-FTRuOVcfaG3sinn22bgU"

3777,"","1.       What is the backup schedule for cloud services?","Google provides a true multi-tenant cloud environment that is dispersed globally. That said, for each of its Cloud Services, Google does provide different levels of capability to designate certain datacenter locations.

To minimize service interruption due to hardware failure, natural disaster, or other catastrophes, Google implements a disaster recovery program at all of its data centers. This program includes multiple components to minimize the risk of any single point of failure, including the following:
 - Data replication and backup: To help ensure availability in the event of a disaster, data is simultaneously replicated to multiple systems within a data center, and also replicated to a secondary data center.
 - Google operates a geographically distributed set of data centers that is designed to maintain service continuity in the event of a disaster or other incident in a single region. High-speed connections between the data centers help ensure swift failover. Management of the data centers is also distributed to provide location-independent, around-the-clock coverage, and system administration.

In addition to the redundancy of data and regionally disparate data centers, Google also has a business continuity plan for its headquarters in Mountain View, CA. This plan accounts for major disasters, such as a seismic event or a public health crisis, and it assumes people and services may be unavailable for up to 30 days. This plan is designed to enable continued operations of Google’s services for its customers. Google conducts regular testing of the Disaster Recovery Plan.

Although it is the intention that customers don't need to implement their own BUR, DR, and HA strategies when leveraging Google's Cloud Services, customers are welcome to implement their own external strategy. APIs and tools are available to allow for data export/migration as well as connectivity to external on-prem resources. Furthermore, Google also has a strong partner ecosystem that provides extended capabilities in this area, such as RightScale, Opscode, Panzura, and TwinStrata.","NYC","2014-07-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XX7GRQ5G-R1sDUT9i0Dt1sa5f7ew2Uc3-pMO_L9m_7M"

4018,"","1.        Describe the components of the platform and tools provided for implementing applications.","Google App Engine makes it easy to build and deploy an application that runs reliably even under heavy load and with large amounts of data. It includes the following features:
* Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transactions.
* Automatic scaling and load balancing.
* Asynchronous task queues for performing work outside the scope of a request.
* Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals.
* Integration with other Google cloud services and APIs.
Applications run in a secure, sandboxed environment, allowing App Engine to distribute requests across multiple servers, and scaling servers to meet traffic demands. Your application runs within its own secure, reliable environment that is independent of the hardware, operating system, or physical location of the server. For a full list of features, see our Features page at https://developers.google.com/appengine/features/.

4024,"","1.       How are organizations modifying their IT policies and governance to support cloud architectures?","Historically, most organizations have designed their policy and governance framework to support on premise infrastructure.  A move to the cloud has forced organizations to shift focus to a standards based approach.  Organizations now need to leverage widely accepted standards suchs as HIPAA, ISO27001, FISMA and FedRAMP and bridge those with internal policy.  Three areas develop with this approach: vendor responsibilities, customer responsibilities, and shared responsibilities.  Only an approach that relies on widely accepted industry standards for governance and security will enable an organization to move part of, or all of their architecture to the cloud.","NYC","2014-07-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XX7GRQ5G-R1sDUT9i0Dt1sa5f7ew2Uc3-pMO_L9m_7M"

4027,"","4.       Given anticipated complexity in the relationship between CSPs and government customers, how long should an initial contractual commitment be?","Contract length should be based on the needs and desires of the City, not the CSPs.  The City should feel comfortable that a contract provides them the appropriate amount of control and flexibility to best serve its needs.  We don't believe epic 5-10 year contract terms are required or serve as a long term benefit of the City.  The industry is simply moving too fast for Governments to have vendor ""Lock-in"".  For example we were recently told by a very large state government that their System Integrator was charging $1.89 per GB of Storage while Google and other Cloud Platform vendors were charging $0.02 for the equivalent.

4029,"","5.       Should customers bring CSPs together at the same table or manage each relationship separately?","This depends on the goal of the customer.  In general Google prefers to deal with the customer directly with our professional services partners.  We have found private cloud vendors would prefer to offer traditional one to one hosting offerings but truthfully we believe a large City or State can be successful running their own Datacenter and contract with Public Clouds when the business and budgets dictate.

4033,"","9.       How does cloud computing impact the customer’s staffing model?","In the next two years the impact will most likely increase headcount slightly towards application development.  Longer term, headcount will likely remain static as the customer maintains a mix of on premise and cloud based systems.  Particularly in Government where there seems to be a significant backlog of IT Projects and internal customer needs, the promise of lowering headcount or reducing FTEs has largely been exaggerated.

Most data centers use just as much non-computing or “overhead” energy (like cooling and power conversion) as they do to power their servers. At Google, we’ve reduced this overhead to only 12% -- a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.12. That way, most of the energy we use powers the machines directly serving Google searches and products. We take detailed measurements to continually push toward doing more with less—serving more users while wasting less energy.

4086,"","1.       What is the cloud provider’s vision for cloud services in the next 3-5 years?","We are in the midst of two major platform shifts - from desktop to mobile and on-premise infrastructure to multi-tenant public cloud. This shift has created new models of delivering personalized, interactive content and services resulting in new disruptive business models in areas like Government, Education, Transportation and Facility Automation. At the most recent Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) partners conference, Mary Meeker delivered her latest report that captures this well. http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends  Most employees and citizens will consume apps, content and services primarily on their mobile devices, and it’s likely those services will be built in the cloud. The data from those interactions and usage patterns will create new insights and opportunities to optimize and innovate. While consumers are leading this trend, business, Government, and Education customers are following suit, albeit at a slower pace.  Technology operators need to make some changes in their vision and their plans to accelerate their Public Cloud growth or simply be left with budget busting systems and unsatisfied internal/external customers.

Google is in a great position to lead this transition with many critical advantages - the largest mobile platform in Android, 15 years of expertise in cloud infrastructure, a world-class set of productivity applications in Google Apps and critical mass in enterprise go-to-market teams. Recently, we accelerated our efforts through investment, such as:
Android - Acquisition of Divide, a commitment to build out increasingly  Enterprise functionality,   Cloud - Re-oriented Google’s Cloud Platform Product Area to focus on external developers within enterprises. Acquired Stackdriver for analytics and insights in Cloud Platform.  And in Software as Service we have Apps - We Built Drive for Work, and launched Chromebox for Meetings.

4140,"Solution costs ","1. Pfizer expects to use the solution as described in the “Scenario” worksheet. Based on this projected usage, we have modeled Pfizer’s expected consumption of the service across different department for a selection of months, and have provided tables in the “Question 53” worksheet. 

Please review this worksheet and complete the blank columns (Columns E and K) to show the cost for each Pfizer department, and total invoice cost for the following months; 7, 15, 28, 40.

Please also complete the columns to show the full year cost for Year 1 (12 months cumulative) and cumulative years; 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5, based Pfizer's expected usage of the solution.

Additionally, please provide a sample billing report/tenancy report and invoice, showing how the solution enables Pfizer to identify usage across the listed departments for each month and each cumulative years timeframe.


","We have provided a pricing indication in the Question 53 sheet as requested. Note that in the section starting with the header “Select Year Cost Per Department” on row 36 indicates storage amounts which are far above the amounts described in the “Scenario” sheet. For instance, on row 68 in the section “Years 1-5 (Cumulative 60 Months)” the total amount is storage is given as 156,610,560GB--over 150PB of data. This is likely either an error in formulating the data or we are interpreting the data incorrectly. We have added a pricing indication on this row, but the section above “Select Year Cost Per Department” has prices that are far more closely aligned with the scenario described in the “Scenario” sheet. 

In addition to the costs in the spreadsheet there is a 5 year hybrid infrastructure subscription cost of $403,920 (equivalent to $6,732 per month).

Please note the following assumptions that have informed the indication. Some of these assumptions are subject to change based on the final deployed architecture.

- Percentage of Storage using Google Nearline Storage: 60%.  Taking advantage of GCS Nearline Storage can greatly reduce overall storage costs. The disadvantage of Nearline storage is greater retrieval time and an additional retrieval cost. 

- Avere FXT cold storage retrieval rate: 20%. We assume that 20% of reads will not be serviced by the cache at either the vFXT or FXT layers and will require a read from Google Cloud Storage. This is an important assumption as it affects both network egress costs from the Google Cloud to Pfizer and the costs of GCS operations. This 20% estimate will be refined over the course of the project as we better understand usage patterns.

- Gold Support Level. We assume that Pfizer will choose the Google Cloud Platform Gold Support Level which gives Pfizer 24x7 phone support, faster initial response times, consultations on application development, and application architectures for your specific use case.

- This pricing indication assumes a minimum commitment of 4PB usage over 5 years. Pricing may vary based on a lower storage commitment. 

- In estimating network egress charges we assume Pfizer has or will establish an enterprise-grade connection to Google's network edge. 

Google also has the option for a one month of nearline storage free as part of our “Switch & Save” program. This requires a 12 month commitment and more than 1PB of storage.","Pfizer Cloud Storage","2015-12-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYWxHnTsQmAtWK750m22xeLmsmYzirhcFUDJUd_zuXY"

Google is committed to the security and this is regularly reinforced by company executives.  Annual security training is mandated, compliance is reviewed by all people managers and employees are notified of any changes to security policy.

Google is committed to the security of all information stored on its computer systems. This commitment is regularly reinforced by management and is outlined in the Google Code of Conduct, which is posted on Google’s website at http://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html. Google’s Security Philosophy is also outlined at the following page: http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/security.html. 

The foundation of Google’s commitment to security is its set of security policies that cover physical, account, data, corporate services, network and computer systems, applications services, systems services, change management, incident response, and data center security. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis by Google's executive team to help ensure their continued effectiveness and accuracy.

In addition to these security policies, with which all persons employed by Google must comply, Google has a dedicated Security Team, which has responsibility for a security program that includes strategic reviews, training, review and compliance activities and internal advocacy.

It is Google’s policy to consider the security properties and implications of applications, systems, and services used or provided by Google throughout the entire project lifecycle. Google’s Applications, Systems, and Services Security Policy instructs Google teams and individuals to implement appropriate security measures in applications, systems, and services being developed, commensurate with identiﬁed security risks and concerns.

(Cipher Block Chaining) mode. Each object stored in the cloud is encrypted using a randomly generated Data
Encryption Key (DEK). The DEK is encrypted with a Key Encrypting Key (KEK), which is known as Key Wrapping
(RFC 3394). The wrapped DEK is stored along with the object. During decryption, the DEK is first unwrapped
using the KEK, and then the object payload is decrypted using the DEK.
After encrypting the object, a Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) using SHA-512 is calculated over
the encrypted object, and the resulting code is appended to the object. For HMAC calculation, a separate
randomly generated key is used, which is also wrapped with the KEK and stored with the object.","Pfizer Cloud Storage","2015-12-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYWxHnTsQmAtWK750m22xeLmsmYzirhcFUDJUd_zuXY"

Generating a new one can rotate the KEK. Historic and current KEKs are kept in a key database for each cloud core filer.

The cluster administrator can download the key database, but it must first be encrypted with a user-supplied passphrase. The AES key is used to encrypt the key database. The encrypted key database is downloaded at the time of KEK creation. It is the cluster administrator’s responsibility to securely backup the key database and provide the passphrase for recovery.

This program includes multiple components to minimize the risk of any single point of failure. To help ensure availability in the event of a disaster, data is replicated to one or more data centers. Google operates a geographically distributed set of data centers that are designed to maintain service continuity in the event of a disaster or other incident in a single region. High-speed connections between the data centers help ensure swift failover. Management of the data centers is also distributed to provide location-independent, around-the-clock coverage and system administration. In addition to the redundancy of data and regionally disparate data centers, Google also has a business continuity plan for its headquarters in Mountain View, California. This plan accounts for major disasters, such as seismic events or a public health crisis, and it assumes people and services may be unavailable for up to 30 days.

","Yes, caching devices are core to the solution. We recommend a cluster at each location where data is created and consumed.  There are no limits to the amount of data in an object store an FXT cluster can address.  Based on client access patterns and the predictive algorithms running in the Avere, we automatically and dynamically promote and demote data up and down the stack. (at a 16K block range)
 
Avere algorithms categorize all the data as hot, warm, or cold.
 
RAM holds the most active or hot data. Each Avere node will utilize 384GB RAM and additional NVRAM for reading and writing hot data.
 
SSD will hold the warm data. Each Avere node will have 9.6TB of SSD media in it. 

Google Cloud Storage stores the cold data that has not been recently accessed. In typical enterprise storage environments, more than 90% of the total data is cold, so Google Cloud Storage provides a very dense, cost-effective storage solution.
 
As demand grows, horizontal clustering enables scaling of the cluster to keep pace. Avere’s horizontal clustering scales to 50 nodes in a cluster to enable performance scaling to massive levels.

See Question 53 for pricing indication.

Downtime also does not include loss of external connectivity as a result of the Google managed VPN service failing to serve traffic directed to VPN tunnels under that service. That sort of downtime is addressed exclusively in the VPN SLA.

Since Cloud computing became widely available, public Cloud prices have fallen at 6-8% annually. While this may seem significant in the abstract, when you consider the larger trends in compute pricing over the last several decades, we don’t think 6%-8% comes close to reflecting the true economics of computing. Over the same period of time, the underlying hardware has fallen at 20-30% annually - following Moore’s Law. In order for Public Cloud to be a true substitute for the legacy premises-based model, we think pricing has to more accurately reflect these savings. As such, Google introduced a pricing model that will more closely follow the trends in Moore’s Law.

Those files will be assigned 64 bit random file names so it is very difficult to distinguish which file belongs to what user without access to the Google proprietary tools. This storage manner makes it very difficult to attack a specific users, or even the entire client's data as it is intermingled with millions of other users’ data in a non-human readable manner.

Infrastructure maintenance events don't have a set interval between occurrences, but generally happen once every couple of months.

Shortly before a maintenance event, Compute Engine changes a special attribute in a virtual machine's metadata server before any attempts to live migrate or terminate and restart the virtual machine as part of a pending infrastructure maintenance event. The maintenance-event attribute will be updated before and after an event, allowing you to detect when these events are imminent. You can use this information to help automate any scripts or commands you want to run before and/or after a maintenance event.

The discount increases with usage and you can get up to a 30% net discount for instances that run the entire month. Sustained use discounts are calculated and applied to your bill as your project earns them.
Sustained use discounts are given on incremental use after certain usage thresholds are reached.

While this may seem significant in the abstract, when you consider the larger trends in compute pricing over the last several decades, we don’t think 6%-8% comes close to reflecting the true economics of computing. Over the same period of time, the underlying hardware has fallen at 20-30% annually - following Moore’s Law. In order for Public Cloud to be a true substitute for the legacy premises-based model, we think pricing has to more accurately reflect these savings.

Provide a range of performance covering small to very large datasets for the following activities.  Compare your performance to competitors and point us to publicly accessible information (white papers, benchmarks, etc.) that support your positions.
- Data read, write performance (MB/sec & Ops/sec range) within your cloud service.  Two scenarios: between storage options or from storage to an image/instance (& vice-versa).
- Data read, write performance (MB/sec; Ops/sec) between your cloud service and another public cloud service.  Two scenarios: moving data from your service to the other service and vice-versa.
- Data read, write performance (MB/sec & Ops/sec range) between your cloud services and customer environments. Two scenarios: from the customer into your environment and vice-versa.","Google cannot share any actual performance metrics publicly. However, performance of data movement will mostly depend on your network bandwidth. Google has one of the largest IP networks in the world and all of its datacenters are connected by its own fiber that provides extremely high bandwidth and low latency between all of its datacenters, including the use of Openflow within its network. Thus, once any request enters Google's network from your network through the closest Point of Presence (PoP) performance is exceptionally fast. Additionally, Google maintains direct network peering relationships with all Tier 1 and many Tier 2 ISP providers to provide even faster connectivity to its services. Furthermore, Google has implemented many proprietary capabilties from its networks, to its hardware, to its OS, to its file system, to its services to make the most efficient use of its massive computng resources to provice performance, scale, and reliability that serves as a key differentiator from its competitors. Lastly, Google also provides the ability for direct network peering with customers to further facilitate data movement and performance.","U of Michigan","2013-01-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fGfx3fbiBM6-0tME8UibonEaAalvJmieXjph4LZ02Zs"

- Briefly describe your management console, APIs and command line capabilities available for end-users to provision and manage resources within your evironment.  Compare your capabilities with those of your competitors, and point us to publicly accessible information (white papers, benchmarks, etc.) that support your positions.
- Can a User establish a process to automatically clean-up/flag unneeded resources (VM instance/image; storage and other) to avoid inadvertent/accidental accrual of extra cost using your services?  If so, provide a brief description of the tools/approach.","The Google Compute Engine API provides a RESTful interface for interacting with your resources. You can use a variety of different methods to access the API:

- Compute Engine console
- gcutil command-line tool
- RESTful API

Compute Engine console: browser based console that you can use to list, create, and delete your instances and disks, and to list information about your networks, firewalls, and zones, such as the size of your disks, the firewalls attached to a network, or the zones available to you.

gcutil command-line tool: command-line tool that is used to manage your Google Compute Engine resources. As a differentiator, Google Compute Engine uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate and authorize access. The first time you run a command using gcutil, it will prompt you to request the required auth token.

RESTful API: available to manage ( delete/get/insert/list/patch) your cloud resources such as disks, firewalls, images, instances, Kernels, MachineTypes, Networks, Operations, Projects, Zones and Snapshots.

As far as Identity Management, when you write applications that need to talk to other Google services, you need to authenticate your application to these services before you can perform any operations or access any data. Often times, you can authenticate these applications using the standard OAuth 2.0 flow, but Google Compute Engine makes this process simpler by providing service accounts. When you create a Google Compute Engine project, Google Compute Engine also creates a service account for that project. This service account authenticates the project to other Google services but you can also use the service account to authenticate your instances to other APIs. This is ideal for cases when you have applications running within instances that need to programmatically talk between services but doesn't need access to user data. For example, lets say you want to write an application that runs within a VM instance. This application saves and retrieves log files to and from Google Cloud Storage but in order for the application to talk to Google Cloud Storage, it needs to authenticate to the Google Cloud Storage API. You can use the standard OAuth 2.0 flow (as briefly described in the table below) to do so or you can save yourself several steps if you set up your instance to use service accounts. Your application can then authenticate seamlessly to Google Cloud Storage and other Google APIs without having to perform the full OAuth 2.0 flow, which is handled by the instance.

As far as resource management, a Project resource is the root collection and settings resource for all Google Compute Engine resources. The Project resource is created using the Google APIs Console when you activate Google Compute Engine for a project. Some administration tasks can only be done from the console, and others must be done from within Google Compute Engine: for instance, adding team members, listing projects, and setting ACLs, can only be done within the console; creating instances, disks, or other resources for a project can only be done directly in the API. You can add a user to your project using the Google APIs Console. When you add a user to your Google Compute Engine project, it gives them access to all Google Compute Engine resources in that project, as described by their roles e.g., viewer, writer, or owner. For example, if you add a user as an owner, they will be able to add and modify Google Compute Engine resources in the project.

Automatically clean-up/flag unneeded resources: Every instance has metadata associated with it. Some of this metadata is assigned from information passed in via flags at startup time or inherited from the containing project; other information, such as the host name, are assigned by Google Compute Engine during the startup process. Every instance stores their metadata on the metadata server. You can query this metadata server programmatically for information such as the instance's host name, instance ID, startup scripts, and custom metadata passed in at startup. Although you can get some of this information in other ways, such as by calling gcutil getinstance or gcutil getproject, the metadata server provides a way to get this information programmatically, which can be useful. For instance, if you want to pass in custom variables that are used by your startup scripts to configure an instance, you can do so using the metadata server. Using a combination of metadata tags and available APIs, Compute Engine Resources can be flagged for clean up and processing in an automated fashion.","U of Michigan","2013-01-01","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fGfx3fbiBM6-0tME8UibonEaAalvJmieXjph4LZ02Zs"

That said, for each of its Cloud Services, Google does provide different levels of capability to designate certain datacenter locations.

To minimize service interruption due to hardware failure, natural disaster, or other catastrophes, Google implements a disaster recovery program at all of its data centers. This program includes multiple components to minimize the risk of any single point of failure, including the following:
 - Data replication and backup: To help ensure availability in the event of a disaster, data is simultaneously replicated to multiple systems within a data center, and also replicated to a secondary data center.
 - Google operates a geographically distributed set of data centers that is designed to maintain service
continuity in the event of a disaster or other incident in a single region. High-speed connections between the data centers help ensure swift failover. Management of the data centers is also distributed to provide location-independent, around-the-clock coverage, and system administration.

In addition to the redundancy of data and regionally disparate data centers, Google also has a business continuity plan for its headquarters in Mountain View, CA. This plan accounts for major disasters, such as a seismic event or a public health crisis, and it assumes people and services may be unavailable for up to 30 days.
